# Weed Wipe Controller
This project involves the creation of a touch screen-based controller for a weed wipe farm equipment using an Arduino microcontroller. The controller will feature a touch screen display that allows farmers to turn the pump on and off and control the pump rate. The Arduino will be programmed to receive user inputs from the touch screen and control the operation of the pump accordingly. The system will also include a feedback mechanism that allows farmers to monitor the current status of the pump and adjust its rate in real-time. The goal of this project is to provide farmers with a simple, yet effective solution for controlling the pump used in their weed wiping operations. The touch screen interface will make it easy for farmers to operate the pump, while the ability to control the pump rate will allow them to adjust the flow of poison to suit their specific needs.
